## Step-by-Step Setting up Instructions - To use this project as your starting point  üöÄ  
### To create the whole project


1. Go to your source directory in your terminal and run the command `https://github.com/zhjiang1103/finalproject.git NAMENEWDIRECTORY`

2. To clean the owner git out of the main directory, run the command `rm -rf .git`

3. Run the command `git init` to start your own git track 

4. Go to the server folder in the project (`cd server`) and run the command `npm install`

5. Inside your server folder, open the file `.env.example` and copy the correct option for your configuration found there to your new .env file. 

Here is what your `.env` might look like:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost/database"
openai_key = "...."
MovieDB_API_KEY = "..."

//Config values for Auth0 - 
SECRET=""
BASEURL="http://localhost:3000"
CLIENTID=""
ISSUER=""

//change from DB_URI to DATABASE_URL
``` 

6. Go to the client folder in the project (`cd .. and cd client`) and run the command `npm install --save --legacy-peer-deps`

üîé The `npm install` command installs the required dependencies defined in the package.json files and generates a node_modules folder with the installed modules.

7. If you want to run both servers concurrently (which is already a npm dependency on the server) you can keep the script in the package.json in the server that reads `"dev": " concurrently 'npm start' 'cd .. && cd client && npm run dev' "`. If you run the command `npm run dev` from within your server, both the client and backend servers will start.

10. Go to localhost:3000 and you should see something like this  üí™

![You will something like this in your terminal.](https://d2j4gdpjmxjmy3.cloudfront.net/v2/147471/contents/evmDhgkElJjrKFRp/mw1920_Screen_Shot_2023-10-23_at_11.20.51_AM.png)

‚ö° **Notes** ‚ö°  
* React requires **Node >= 14.0.0** & **npm >= 5.6**
* Please note that your backend server will run from `port 8080`, and your frontend React server will run from `port 3000`.
